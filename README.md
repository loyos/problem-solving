Problems are solved using plain JavaScript. Feel free to try different languages. The important part is to understand how to solve the problems using the right structures and approaches.

The exercises here are not fully optimized, try to improve them.


##### Instructions

- npm install
- npm test

Each folder corresponds to a pattern, for testing we're using jest. Every pattern has a test file.

Feel free to add problems to this repository, remember to include tests
